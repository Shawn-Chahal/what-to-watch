# What to watch?

This repository builds a MongoDB database and a prototype front-end which is used in the [What to watch?](https://www.shawnchahal.com/what-to-watch) web app.

## What does the app do?

[What to watch?](https://www.shawnchahal.com/what-to-watch) is a web app where the user rates movies and gets recommendations. The app employs collaborative filtering in Python on user ratings from the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) stored in a MongoDB database.
